# Problem Description
*Predictive Maintenance of Systems.-* Based on the energy consumption 
and other device-dependent features we want to predict whether the 
device will fail.

# Target market
The customers that could benefit from this service (Predictive Maintenance of Systems)
are the *corporate customers* which constantly monitor the status of critical components 
of their production line. 

# Showcase scenario
To demonstrate the implementation of Logistic Regression for Machine Predictive Maintenance Classification we will use the following [dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/AI4I+2020+Predictive+Maintenance+Dataset)
Extra information and analysis related to the above dataset can be found on the Kaggle [link](https://www.kaggle.com/shivamb/machine-predictive-maintenance-classification)
