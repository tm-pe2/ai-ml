# Problem Description
*Predictive Maintenance of Systems.-* Based on the energy consumption 
and other device-dependent features we want to predict whether the 
device will fail.

# Target market
The customers that could benefit from this service (Predictive Maintenance of Systems)
are the *corporate customers* which constantly monitor the status of critical components 
of their production line. 

# Showcase scenario
To demonstrate the implementation of Logistic Regression for Machine Predictive Maintenance Classification we will use the following [dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/AI4I+2020+Predictive+Maintenance+Dataset)
Extra information and analysis related to the above dataset can be found on the Kaggle [link](https://www.kaggle.com/shivamb/machine-predictive-maintenance-classification)
The dataset from the UCI and Kagle differ by the Type of Failure (UCI dataset) which is encoded as Failure type in the Kagle dataset version reducing in this way the number of columns to deal with.

# Required Libraries:
```console
pip install numpy pandas imblearn seaborn xgboost
```
