# Problem Description
*Predictive Maintenance of Systems.-* Based on the energy consumption 
and other device-dependent features we want to predict whether the 
device will fail.

# Target market
The customers that could benefit from this service (Predictive Maintenance of Systems)
are the *corporate customers* which constantly monitor the status of critical components 
of their production line. 

# Showcase scenario
To demonstrate the implementation of Logistic Regression we will use Kaggle 
[database](https://www.kaggle.com/shivamb/machine-predictive-maintenance-classification) built for Machine Predictive Maintenance Classification.
