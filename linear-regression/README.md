# Problem Description
Explore machine learning algorithms Based on the energy consumption data. Decide which algorithm works the best for our company.


# Scenario
To demonstrate the implementation of Linear Regression for Machine Predictive Maintenance Classification the following datasets; 
- [dataset1](https://data.world/city-of-phoenix/598be280-a5ce-4c77-b802-321756332dfb) 
- [dataset2](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/individual+household+electric+power+consumption) will be used.

Extra information and analysis related to the above dataset can be found on the [data.world](https://data.world/city-of-phoenix/598be280-a5ce-4c77-b802-321756332dfb) and [UCI](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/individual+household+electric+power+consumption#)

The datasets from the UCI and data.world differ by the type of features, for which one has advantages over the other.

# Required Libraries:
